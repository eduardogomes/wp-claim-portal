# Deploying this Claim Portal to Heroku

1. Get a free [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/) if you haven't already.

Also install the [local Postgres tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup)

3. [Install Node](https://nodejs.org), this will be our server environment. Then open up your terminal and make sure you're running the latest version of npm, installed globally (the ```-g``` switch):

    ```
    sudo npm install npm -g
    ```

4. Clone this project and switch into the project directory.

    Creating app... done, â¬¢ mystic-wind-83
    Created http://mystic-wind-83.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:mystic-wind-83.git
    ```

    ```
    You can exit the psql application using Control(^)+D
